"""
This module implements the Spectrum class

A Spectrum is the representation of a sound as a list of partials
in time. Normally these partials are the result of a partial-tracking
analysis.

This partial tracking representation can be used to manipulate the
sound (transpose in frequency, scale in time, quantize pitch, etc)
and can be also the basis for transcription in music notation.
