    """
    Creates a score representing a clicktrack of the given ScoreStruct

    Args:
        struct: the ScoreStruct
        minMeasures: if given, the minimum number of measures. This might be needed
            in the case of an endless scorestruct
        clickdur: the length of each tick, None to use the duration of the beat. The
            duration of the playback can be set individually from the duration of the
            displayed note.
        strongBeatPitch: the pitch to use as a strong tick
        weakBeatPitch: the pitch to use as a weak tick
        middleBeatPitch: pitch used for beginning of secondary groups for
            compound time signatures (signatures of the form 4/4+3/8)
        playpreset: the preset instr to use for playback. The default plays the given
            pitches two octaves higher as very short clicks
        fade: a fadetime for the clicks

    Returns:
        a :class:`~maelzel.core.score.Score`
