    Converted from/based on a MATLAB script at http://billauer.co.il/peakdet.html

    Algorithm for detecting local maximas and minimas in a signal.
    Discovers peaks by searching for values which are surrounded by lower
    or larger values for maximas and minimas respectively

    Args:
        y_axis (array like): A list containg the signal over which to find peaks
        x_axis (array like): A x-axis whose values correspond to the 'y_axis' list and
            is used in the return to specify the postion of the peaks. If omitted the index
            of the y_axis is used. (default: None)
        lookahead: (optional) distance to look ahead from a peak candidate to
            determine if it is the actual peak (default: 500)
            '(sample / period) / f' where '4 >= f >= 1.25' might be a good value
        delta: (optional) this specifies a minimum difference between a peak and
            the following points, before a peak may be considered a peak. Useful
            to hinder the algorithm from picking up false peaks towards to end of
            the signal. To work well delta should be set to 'delta >= RMSnoise * 5'.
            (default: 0)
                Delta function causes a 20% decrease in speed, when omitted
                Correctly used it can double the speed of the algorithm

    Returns:
        (maxima, minima)

    NB: to get the average peak value do:

    Algorithm for detecting local maximas and minimas in a signal.

    Discovers peaks by dividing the signal into bins and retrieving the
    maximum and minimum value of each the even and odd bins respectively.
    Division into bins is performed by smoothing the curve and finding the
    zero crossings.

    Suitable for repeatable sinusoidal signals with some amount of RMS noise
    tolerable. Excecutes faster than 'peakdetect', although this function will
    break if the offset of the signal is too large. It should also be noted
    that the first and last peak will probably not be found, as this algorithm
    only can find peaks between the first and last zero crossing.
