Core (maelzel.core)
-------------------

**maelzel.core** provides a set of classes to define notes, chords, sequences, voices or
entire scores. These musical objects can be used for composition, analysis or any kind of
computation related to music/sound. They can be played in real time, recorded
and displayed as notation.

Scoring - General Purpose notation (maelzel.scoring)
----------------------------------------------------

The **maelzel.scoring** package can be used for general purpose musical notation. It provides
the notation functionality used by **maelzel.core** but it can be used independently. 
It implements a very flexible and robust quantization engine (see :py:mod:`maelzel.scoring.quant`)
and can output *musicxml*, *lilypond* and *midi* as well as render to *pdf* and *png* via 
multiple backends (*lilypond*, *musescore*)
