maelzel.core
============

**maelzel.core** provides a set of classes to define notes, chords,
lines, sequences, voices and entire scores. Any of these objects can
be played in real time, recorded and displayed as notation. When
converting to notation a score is quantized following a score
structure.

**maelzel.core**'s main purpose is to represent musical ideas, reason
about aspects of pitch, rhythms, etc., and be of help while composing,
analyzing or preparing a performance. Even if it is possible to
construct a score, notation is in this context a tool to visualize
results and it is not a goal to be able to produce final
scores with highly customized engraving.
