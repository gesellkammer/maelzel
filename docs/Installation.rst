External Dependencies
---------------------

There are some external dependencies which need to be installed manually:

* **csound** >= 6.16. (https://csound.com/download.html). Csound 7 is not supported yet.
* **lilypond** (https://lilypond.org/download.html)
* **MuseScore** (https://musescore.org/en) - Useful for quick rendering to png

.. note::

    On some linux distributions the *csound* package provided is too
    old. *csound* can easily be installed from source by following
    these instructions: https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/BUILD.md#debian
