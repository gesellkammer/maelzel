Installation
============

`csoundengine` needs a python version >= 3.8. For all platforms, the installation is 
the same::

Dependencies
------------

`csoundengine` needs a recent version of csound (at least 6.16). Csound can be downloaded from 
`<https://github.com/csound/csound/releases>`_


.. note::

   The csound version packaged with most linux distributions is often
   too old. The best way to install csound is to install it from
   source. See `Csound's BUILD documentation <https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/develop/BUILD.md>`_
