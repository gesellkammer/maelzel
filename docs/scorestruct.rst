Score Structure
===============

This module defines a Score Structure class (:class:`ScoreStruct`)

A :class:`ScoreStruct` holds the structure of a score
(its skeleton): it is a list of measure definitions (see :meth:`~ScoreStruct.addMeasure`),
where each measure definition includes a time-signature, tempo and optional annotations.
A :class:`ScoreStruct` provides utilities to convert between score locations,
quarternote time and absolute time position.

Score structure â‰  score contents
--------------------------------

A :class:`~maelzel.scorestruct.ScoreStruct` does not hold any actual
content (notes, chords, silences, etc), it just provides a skeleton
to organize such content within the given structure

Beat time vs Real time
----------------------

*Real time* is the actual clock time, measured in seconds. *Beat time* refers to a
symbolic time, measured in quarternotes. For example, an event (a note) starting at
``beat=2.5`` with a duration of ``0.5`` beats means that the event starts ``2+1/2``
quarternotes after the beginning and has a duration of an eighth note. The exact
location in *Real time* depends on the tempo and on any tempo changes before
and during the event.

To convert between *beat time* and *real time* see :meth:`~ScoreStruct.beatToTime` and
:meth:`~ScoreStruct.timeToBeat`.

Score Location
--------------

As mentioned above, *beat time* is measured in quarternotes since the beginning.
Within a score with time-signature changes there is a more convenient way to indicate
time: a :class:`ScoreLocation`, which is basically a tuple ``(measure index, beat offset)``.
See :meth:`~ScoreStruct.locationToTime`, :meth:`~ScoreStruct.timeToLocation`

.. note::

    Measure indexes start at 0


Rational Numbers
----------------

As in the rest of **maelzel**, any variable or attribute dealing with
time (in beats, seconds, tempo, etc) is a rational number
(a :class:`maelzel.rational.Rat`). **This is done to avoid rounding errors**

ScoreStruct and maelzel.core
----------------------------

:class:`ScoreStruct` is used extensively within :py:mod:`maelzel.core`. If
**maelzel.core** has been imported used a ScoreStruct can be used as a context
manager to set a temporary score structure:

.. code-block:: python

    from maelzel.core import *
    from maelzel.music.scale import *

    scale = Chain([Note(m, 0.5) for m in pitchscale('3C', steps='major', endpitch='5C')])
    with ScoreStruct(timesig=(3, 4), quarterTempo=72):
        scale.show()
        scale.play()

When played the playback tempo will be set to 72. After the context manager is exited
the previous state is restored.
