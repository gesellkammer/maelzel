maelzel - Documentation
=======================

**maelzel** is a framework for doing computer music in python. It is
based on a :ref:`core<core>` package, which provides datatypes to define *notes*,
*chords*, *sequences*, *lines*, *voices*, *scores*, etc. Other modules 
provide functionality for working with sound (loading soundfiles, working
with samples, applying filters, fading, mixing, playback), 
sound analysis, music, acoustics, music notation, etc.
